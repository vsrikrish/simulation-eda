## The Bootstrap

- **Bootstrap Principle**: Use the data as a proxy for the population.
- **Key**: Bootstrap gives idea of sampling error in statistics (including model parameters)
- Distribution of $\tilde{t} - \hat{t}$ approximates distribution around estimate $\hat{t} - t_0$.
- Allows us to estimate uncertainty of estimates (confidence intervals, bias, etc).
- Parametric bootstrap introduces model specification error

## Bootstrap Variants

  - Resample Cases (Non-Parametric)
  - Resample Residuals (Semi-Parametric)
  - Simulate from Fitted Model (Parametric)

## Which Bootstrap To Use?

- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Parametric Bootstrap has narrowest intervals, Resampling Cases widest (*Exercise 8*)
- Depends on trust in model "correctness": 
  - Do we trust the model parameters to be "correct"?
  - Do we trust the shape of the regression model?
  - Do we trust the data-generating process?

# Bayesian Computation

## Reminder: Bayesian Modeling

Probability is the *degree of belief in a "proposition"*.

Then it makes sense to discuss the *probability* of

- model parameters $\mathbf{\theta}$
- unobserved data $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}$ 

conditional on the observations $\mathbf{y}$, which we can denote:
$$p(\mathbf{\theta} | \mathbf{y}) \text{ or } p(\tilde{\mathbf{y}} | \mathbf{y})$$

## Conditioning on Observations

This fundamental conditioning on observations $\mathbf{y}$ is a distinguishing feature of Bayesian inference.

**Compare**: frequentist approaches are based on re-estimated over the distribution of possible $\mathbf{y}$ conditional on the "true" parameter value.

## Bayes' Rule

Update priors with Bayes' Rule:

$$\underbrace{{p(\theta | y)}}_{\text{posterior}} = \frac{\overbrace{p(y | \theta)}^{\text{likelihood}}}{\underbrace{p(y)}_\text{normalization}} \overbrace{p(\theta)}^\text{prior}$$

## Goals of Bayesian Computation

1. Sampling from the *posterior* distribution
  $$p(\theta | \mathbf{y})$$
2. Sampling from the *posterior predictive* distribution
  $$p(\tilde{y} | \mathbf{y})$$
  by generating data.

## Bayesian Computation and Monte Carlo

Bayesian computation involves Monte Carlo simulation from the posterior (predictive) distribution.

These samples can then be analyzed to identify estimators, credible intervals, etc.

## Posterior Sampling

Trivial for *extremely* simple problems: 

1. low-dimensional.
2. with "conjugate" priors (which make the posterior a closed-form distribution).

For example: normal likelihood, normal prior &Rightarrow; normal posterior


## A First Algorithm: Rejection Sampling

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Idea: 

1. Generate proposed samples from another distribution $g(\theta)$ which covers the target $p(\theta | \mathbf{y})$;
2. Accept those proposals based on the ratio of the two distributions.

![Proposal Distribution for Rejection Sampling](figures/rejection-cover.svg)
:::
::::

## Rejection Sampling Algorithm

Suppose $p(\theta | \mathbf{y}) \leq M g(\theta)$ for some $1 < M < \infty$.

1. Simulate $u \sim \text{Unif}(0, 1)$.
2. Simulate a proposal $\hat{\theta} \sim g(\theta)$.
3. If $u < \frac{p(\hat{\theta} | \mathbf{y})}{Mg(\hat{\theta})},$
  accept $\hat{\theta}$. Otherwise reject.

## Rejection Sampling Challenges

1. Probability of accepting a sample is $1/M$, so the "tighter" the proposal distribution coverage the more efficient the sampler.
2. Need to be able to compute $M$.

Finding a good proposal and computing $M$ may not be easy (or possible) for complex posteriors!

**How can we do better?**

## How Can We Do Better?

The fundamental problem with rejection sampling is that we don't know the properties of the posterior. So we don't know that we have the appropriate coverage. But...

What if we could construct an proposal/acceptance/rejection scheme that necessarily converged to the target distribution, even without *a priori* knowledge of its properties?

# Markov Chain Basics

## What Is A Markov Chain?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}
Consider a stochastic process $\{X_t\}_{t \in \mathcal{T}}$, where 

- $X_t \in \mathcal{S}$ is the state at time $t$, and 
- $\mathcal{T}$ is a time-index set (can be discrete or continuous)
- $\mathbb{P}(s_i \to s_j) = p_{ij}$. 
::: 
::: {.column width=40%}
![Markov State Space](figures/markov-state.png){width=75%}
:::
::::
## Markovian Property

This stochastic process is a **Markov chain** if it satisfies the **Markovian (or memoryless) property**:
$$\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(X_{T+1} = s_i &| X_1=x_1, \ldots, X_T=x_T) = \\ &\qquad\mathbb{P}(X_{T+1} = s_i| X_T=x_T)
\end{align*}
$$

- How can we model the *unconditional* probability $\mathbb{P}(X_T = s_i)$?
- How about the *conditional* probability $\mathbb{P}(X_T = s_i | X_{T-1} = x_{T-1})$?
:::

## Example: Weather

Let's look at a more interesting example. Suppose the weather can be foggy, sunny, or rainy.

Based on past experience, we know that:

1. There are never two sunny days in a row;
2. Even chance of two foggy or two rainy days in a row;
3. A sunny day occurs 1/4 of the time after a foggy or rainy day.

## Aside: Higher Order Markov Chains

Suppose that today's weather depends on the prior *two* days. 

::: {.incremental}
1. Can we write this as a Markov chain?
2. What are the states?
:::

## Weather Transition Matrix

We can summarize these probabilities in a **transition matrix** $P$:
$$
P = 
\begin{array}{cc} 
\begin{array}{ccc}
\phantom{i}\color{red}{F}\phantom{i} & \phantom{i}\color{red}{S}\phantom{i} & \phantom{i}\color{red}{R}\phantom{i}
\end{array}
\\
\begin{pmatrix}
      1/2 & 1/4 & 1/4 \\
      1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\
      1/4 & 1/4 & 1/2
      \end{pmatrix}
&
\begin{array}{ccc}
\color{red}F  \\ \color{red}S  \\ \color{red}R
\end{array}   
\end{array}
$$

Rows are the current state, columns are the next step, so $\sum_i p_{ij} = 1$.

## Weather Example: State Probabilities

Denote by $\lambda^t$ a probability distribution over the states at time $t$.

Then $\lambda^t = \lambda^{t-1}P$:

$$\begin{pmatrix}\lambda^t_F & \lambda^t_S & \lambda^t_R \end{pmatrix} =  
\begin{pmatrix}\lambda^{t-1}_F & \lambda^{t-1}_S & \lambda^{t-1}_R \end{pmatrix} 
      \begin{pmatrix}
      1/2 & 1/4 & 1/4 \\
      1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\
      1/4 & 1/4 & 1/2
      \end{pmatrix}
$$

## Multi-Transition Probabilities

Notice that $$\lambda^{t+i} = \lambda^t P^i,$$ so multiple transition probabilities are $P$-exponentials. 

$$P^3 =
\begin{array}{cc} 
\begin{array}{ccc}
\phantom{iii}\color{red}{F}\phantom{ii} & \phantom{iii}\color{red}{S}\phantom{iii} & \phantom{ii}\color{red}{R}\phantom{iii}
\end{array}
\\
\begin{pmatrix}
      26/64 & 13/64 & 25/64 \\
      26/64 & 12/64 & 26/64 \\
      26/64 & 13/64 & 26/64
      \end{pmatrix}
&
\begin{array}{ccc}
\color{red}F  \\ \color{red}S  \\ \color{red}R
\end{array}   
\end{array}
$$

## Long Run Probabilities

What happens if we let the system run for a while starting from an initial sunny day? 

```{julia}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-align: center
#| label: fig-markov-weather
#| fig-cap: State probabilities for the weather examples.

current = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
P = [1/2 1/4 1/4
    1/2 0 1/2
    1/4 1/4 1/2]   

T = 21

state_probs = zeros(T, 3)
state_probs[1,:] = current
for t=1:T-1
    state_probs[t+1, :] = state_probs[t:t, :] * P
end


p = plot(0:T-1, state_probs, label=["Foggy" "Sunny" "Rainy"], palette=:mk_8, linewidth=3, tickfontsize=16, guidefontsize=18, legendfontsize=16, left_margin=5mm, bottom_margin=10mm)
xlabel!("Time")
ylabel!("State Probability")
plot!(p, size=(1000, 400))
```

## Stationary Distributions

This stabilization always occurs when the probability distribution is an eigenvector of $P$ with eigenvalue 1:

$$\pi = \pi P.$$

This is called an *invariant* or a *stationary* distribution.

## What Markov Chains Have Stationary Distributions?


Not necessarily! The key is two properties:

- Irreducible
- Aperiodicity

## Irreducibility

A Markov chain is **irreducible** if every state is accessible from every other state, *e.g.* for every pair of states $s_i$ and $s_j$ there is some $k > 0$ such that $P_{ij}^k > 0.$

![Reducible Markov Chain](figures/markov-reducible.png)


## Aperiodicity

The period of a state $s_i$ is the greatest common divisor $k$ of all $t$ such that $P^t_{ii} > 0$. 

In other words, if a state $s_i$ has period $k$, all returns must occur after time steps which are multiples of $k$.

A Markov chain is **aperiodic** if all states have period 1.

:::
::::

## Ergodicity

A Markov chain is **ergodic** if it is aperiodic and irreducible.

Ergodic Markov chains have a  *limiting* distribution which is the limit of the time-evolution of the chain dynamics, *e.g.*
$$\pi_j = \lim_{t \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(X_t = s_j).$$

**Key**: this limit is *independent* of the initial state probability.

**Intuition**: Ergodicity means we can exchange thinking about *time-averages* and *ensemble-averages*.

## Limiting Distributions are Stationary

For an ergodic chain, the limiting distribution is the unique stationary distribution (we won't prove uniqueness):

\begin{align}
\pi_j &= \lim_{t \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(X_t = s_j | X_0 = s_i) \\
&= \lim_{t \to \infty} (P^{t+1})_{ij} = \lim_{t \to \infty} (P^tP)_{ij} \\
&= \lim_{t \to \infty} \sum_d (P^t)_{id} P_{dj} \\
&= \sum_d \pi_d P_{dj}
\end{align}

## Transient Portion of the Chain


The portion of the chain prior to convergence to the stationary distribution is called the **transient** portion. 

```{julia}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-align: center
#| label: fig-markov-transient
#| fig-cap: Transient portion of the weather Markov chain.

vspan!(p, [0, 4], color=:red, alpha=0.3, label="Transient Portion")
```

## Detailed Balance

The last important concept is **detailed balance**.

Let $\{X_t\}$ be a Markov chain and let $\pi$ be a probability distribution over the states. Then the chain is in detailed balance with respect to $\pi$ if
$$\pi_i P_{ij} = \pi_j P_{ji}.$$

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Detailed balance implies **reversibility**: the chain's dynamics are the same when viewed forwards or backwards in time.
:::

## Detailed Balance Intuition

A nice analogy (from [Miranda Holmes-Cerfon](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~holmescerfon/)) is traffic flow.

## Detailed Balance and Stationary Distributions

Detailed balance is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the existence of a stationary distribution (namely $\pi$):

$$\begin{align*}
(\pi P)_i &= \sum_j \pi_j P_{ji} \\
&= \sum_j \pi_i P_{ij} \\
&= \pi_i \sum_j P_{ij} = \pi_i
\end{align*}$$


## Idea of Sampling Algorithm

The idea of our sampling algorithm (which we will discuss next time) is to construct an ergodic Markov chain from the detailed balance equation for the target distribution. 

- Detailed balance implies that the target distribution is the stationary distribution.
- Ergodicity implies that this distribution is unique and can be obtained as the limiting distribution of the chain's dynamics.

## Idea of Sampling Algorithm

In other words: 

- Generate an appropriate Markov chain so that its stationary distribution of the target distribution $\pi$;
- Run its dynamics long enough to converge to the stationary distribution;
- Use the resulting ensemble of states as Monte Carlo samples from $\pi$ .

## Sampling Algorithm

Any algorithm which follows this procedure is a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

**Good news**: These algorithms are designed to work quite generally, without (*usually*) having to worry about technical details like detailed balance and ergodicity.

**Bad news**: They *can* involve quite a bit of tuning for computational efficiency. Some algorithms or implementations are faster/adaptive to reduce this need.

## Sampling Algorithm

**Annoying news**: 

- Convergence to the stationary distribution is only guaranteed asymptotically; evaluating if the chain has been run long enough requires lots of heuristics.
- Due to Markovian property, samples are *dependent*, so smaller "effective sample size".


# Key Points and Upcoming Schedule

## Key Points

- Bayesian computation is difficult because we need to sample from effectively arbitrary distributions.
- Markov chains provide a path forward if we can construct a chain satisfying detailed balance whose stationary distribution is the target distribution.
- Then a post-convergence chain of samples is the same as a *dependent* Monte Carlo set of samples.
