    "text": "Community\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nOur goal in this class is to foster an inclusive learning environment and make everyone feel comfortable in the classroom, regardless of social identity, background, and specific learning needs. As engineers, our work touches on many critical aspects of society, and questions of inclusion and social justice cannot be separated from considerations of how data are generated, collected, and analyzed.\nIn all communications and interactions with each other, members of this class community (students and instructors) are expected to be respectful and inclusive. In this spirit, we ask all participants to:\n\nshare their experiences, values, and beliefs;\nbe open to and respectful of the views of others; and\nvalue each other’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner.\n\nPlease let me know if you feel any aspect(s) of class could be made more inclusive. Please also share any preferred name(s) and/or your pronouns with me if you wish: I use he/him/his, and you can refer to me either as Vivek or Prof. Srikrishnan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, Be Excellent To Teach Other\n\n\n\nWe all make mistakes in our communications with one another, both when speaking and listening. Be mindful of how spoken or written language might be misunderstood, and be aware that, for a variety of reasons, how others perceive your words and actions may not be exactly how you intended them. At the same time, it is also essential that we be respectful and interpret each other’s comments and actions in good faith.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Accomodations\nLet me know if you have any access barriers in this course, whether they relate to course materials, assignments, or communications. If any special accomodations would help you navigate any barriers and improve your chances of success, please exercise your right to those accomodations and reach out to me as early as possible with your Student Disability Services (SDS) accomodation letter. This will ensure that we have enough time to make appropriate arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need more immediate accomodations, but do not yet have a letter, please let me know and then follow up with SDS.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Communications\nMost course communications will occur via Ed Discussion. Public Ed posts are generally preferred to private posts or emails, as other students can benefit from the discussions. If you would like to discuss something privately, please do reach out through email or a private Ed post (which will only be viewable by you and the course staff).\nAnnouncements will be made on the course website and in Ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Tips\n\n\n\n\nIf you wait until the day an assignment is due (or even late the previous night) to ask a question on Ed, there is a strong chance that I will not see your post prior to the deadline.\nBut if you see unanswered questions and you have some insight, please answer! This class will work best when we all work together as a community.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health Resources\nWe all have to take care of our mental health, just as we would our physical health. As a student, you may experience a range of issues which can negatively impact your mental health. Please do not ignore any of these stressors, or feel like you have to navigate these challenges alone! You are part of a community of students, faculty, and staff, who have a responsibility to look for one another’s well-being. If you are struggling with managing your mental health, or if you believe a classmate may be struggling, please reach out to the course instructor, the TA, or, for broader support, please take advantage of Cornell’s mental health resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health And This Class\n\n\n\nI am not a trained counselor, but I am here to support you in whatever capacity we can. You should never feel that you need to push yourself past your limits to complete any assignment for this class or any other. If we need to make modifications to the course or assignment schedule, you can certainly reach out to me, and all relevant discussions will be kept strictly confidential.",

    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAttendance\nAttendance is not required, but in general, students who attend class regularly will do better and get more out of the class than students who do not. Your class participation grade will reflect both the quantity and quality of your participation, only some of which can occur asynchronously. I will put as many course materials, such as lecture notes and announcements, as possible online, but viewing materials online is not the same as active participation and engagement. Life happens, of course, and this may lead you to miss class. Let me know if you need any appropriate arrangements ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I’m Sick?\n\n\n\nPlease stay home if you’re feeling sick! This is beneficial for both for your own recovery and the health and safety of your classmates. We will also make any necessary arrangements for you to stay on top of the class material and if whatever is going on will negatively impact your grade, for example by causing you to be unable to submit an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\nOffice hours will be held in 318 Riley-Robb before class on MW, from 10-11AM, in 318 Riley-Robb Hall. Some time will be available after class for brief questions, but this is limited. If these times do not work for you, or you need some additional time outside of office hours, please reach out to Prof. Srikrishnan about scheduling a meeting. Depending on schedules, these requests may not be accepted on short notice (e.g. homework is due on Friday and you reach out late on Thursday), but with several days notice we should be able to find a time that will work.\nOffice hours are intended to help all students who attend. This time is limited, and is best spent on issues that are relevant to as many students as possible. While we will do our best to answer individual questions, students asking us to verify or debug homework solutions will have the lowest priority (but please do ask about how to verify or debug your own solutions!). However, we are happy to discuss conceptual approaches to solving homework problems, which may help to reveal bugs.\nSpace at office hours can be limited (we may shift to the conference room in 316 Riley-Robb if offices are full and it is available). If the room is crowded and you can find an alternative source of assistance, or if your question is low priority (e.g. debugging) please be kind and make room for others.\n\n\nMask Policies\nMasks are encouraged but not required in the classroom, per university policy. However, the University strongly encourages compliance with requests to mask from students, faculty, and staff who are concerned about the risk of infection. Please be respectful of these concerns and requests if you cannot wear a mask.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat, copy, or plagiarize!\n\n\n\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. However, I expect students to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity in all aspects of this class. All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment). This includes analyses, code, software runs, and reports. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics).\n\n\nExternal Resources\nThe collaborative environment in this class should not be viewed as an invitation for plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when a writer intentionally misrepresents another’s words or ideas (including code!) as their own without acknowledging the source. All external resources which are consulted while working on an assignment should be referenced, including other students and faculty with whom the assignment is discussed. You will never be penalized for consulting an external source for help and referencing it, but plagiarism will result in a zero for that assignment as well as the potential for your case to be passed on for additional disciplinary action.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nAs noted, all work submitted for a grade in this course must reflect your own understanding. The use and consulation of AI/ML tools, such as ChatGPT or similar, must be pre-approved and clearly referenced. If approved, you must:\n\nreference the URL of the service you are using, including the specific date you accessed it;\nprovide the exact query or queries used to interact with the tool; and\nreport the exact response received.\n\nFailure to attain prior approval or fully reference the interaction, as described above, will be treated as plagiarism and referred to the University accordingly.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nIn general, late work can be submitted up to 24 hours after the due date at a 50% penalty. However, sometimes things come up in life. Please reach out ahead of time if you have extenuating circumstances (including University-approved absences or illnesses) which would make it difficult for you to submit your work on time. Note that e.g. job interviews or a busy schedule outside of this course are not valid reasons for extensions. If an extension is granted, any late penalties will be waived up to the extension date. In extreme circumstances, assignments can be forgiven, and your grade will be computed as though those did not occur, giving your other assignments more weight.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests can be submitted up to one week after the graded work is released on Gradescope.\nAll regrade requests must include a brief justification for the request or they will not be considered. Good justifications include (but are not limited to): - My answer agrees with the posted solution, but I still lost points. - I lost 4 points for something, but the rubric says it should only be worth 2 points. - You took points off for something, but it’s right here. - My answer is correct, even though it does not match the posted solution; here is an explanation. - There is no explanation for my grade. - I got a perfect score, but my solution has a mistake (you will receive extra credit for this! see below!) - There is a major error in the posted solution; here is an explanation (full credit for everyone, but Prof. Srikrishnan will decide what constitutes a “major error”! see below!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Can Only Grade What You Submitted\n\n\n\nAll regrades will be assessed based only on the submitted work. You cannot get a higher grade by explanation what you meant (either in person or online) or by adding information or reasoning to what is submitted after the fact. The goal of the regrade is to draw attention to a potential grading problem, not to supplement the submission.\n\n\nOnce Prof. Srikrishnan issues a final response to a regrade request, further requests for that submission will be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegrade Requests Can Be A Gamble!\n\n\n\nWhile you should submit regrade requests for legitimate errors, using them for fishing expeditions can also result in lost points if Prof. Srikrishnan decide that your initial grade was too lenient or if additional errors are identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I Find A Different Type of Mistake?\n\n\n\n\nIf you submit a regrade request correctly reporting that a problem was graded too leniently — that is, that your score was higher than it should be based on the rubric — your score will be increased by the difference. For example, if your original score on a problem was 8/10 and you successfully argue that your score should have been 3/10, your new score will be 13/10.\nIf a significant error is discovered in a posted homework solution or in the exam solutions, everyone will in the class will receive full credit for the (sub)problem. Prof. Srikrishnan will decide what is “significant”.",

Ed Discussion will be used for course communications. Assignments will be submitted and graded in Gradescope.\nStudents can use any programming language they like to solve problems, though we will make notebooks and package environments available for Julia (which may help structure your assignments if you use a different language) via GitHub. If students use a language other than Julia, we may limited in the programming assistance we can provide (though we’re happy to try to help!).\nWe recommend students create a GitHub account and use GitHub to version control and share their code throughout the semester.\n\n\nGrading\nFinal grades will be computed based on the following assessment weights:\n\n\n\nAssessment\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n10%\n\n\nReadings\n10%\n\n\nLiterature Critique\n15%\n\n\nHomework Assignments\n30%\n\n\nTerm Project\n35%\n\n\n\nThe following grading scale will be used to convert the numerical weighted average to letter grades:\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n94–100\n\n\nA-\n90–94\n\n\nB+\n87–90\n\n\nB\n84–87\n\n\nB-\n80–84\n\n\nC+\n77–80\n\n\nC\n74–77\n\n\nC-\n70–74\n\n\nD+\n67–70\n\n\nD\n64–67\n\n\nD-\n61–64\n\n\nF\n&lt; 61\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nMost weeks, students will be given a set of exercises (typically involving analyzing a dataset, a model, or a figure) to complete. These will involve a small amount of programming, a minor calculation, and/or visual assessment of data or a figure. Exercises will be provided the previous Monday and are intended to align with the content for the week, and solutions should be submitted by 9:00pm on the Friday at the end of the given week. These exercises will be given as quizzes on Gradescope and will be auto-graded. The lowest exercise score will be dropped automatically.\n\n\nReadings\nReadings will be assigned for discussion throughout the semester. Students are expected to summarize their takeaways and thoughts on the reading and respond to others’ comments on the Ed forum during the week after the reading is assigned (typically Monday – Monday). Collaborative annotation assignments will be set up in Canvas to facilitate reading ahead of the discussion on the Ed forum. For key readings, a student in BEE 5850 will be assigned to lead a 35 minute in-class discussion on the reading.\n\n\nLiterature Critique\nStudents will select a peer-reviewed journal article related to an application of data analysis and will write a short discussion paper analyzing the hypotheses and statistical choices. Students enrolled in BEE 5850 will also write a referee report, as if they were a peer reviewer. Students will give an in-class presentation of their paper during one class period. Other students will be asked to submit evaluations of the presentations.\n\n\nHomework Assignments\nApproximately 6 homework assignments will be assigned throughout the semester (roughly one per course module). You will typically have 2 weeks to work on each assignment, though this depends on the module length. Students are encouraged to collaborate and learn from each other on homework assignments, but each student must submit their own solutions reflecting their understanding of the material. Consulting and referencing external resources and your peers is encouraged (engineering is a collaborative discipline!), but plagiarism is a violation of academic integrity.\nSome notes on assignment and grading logistics:\n\nHomeworks are due by 9:00pm Eastern Time on the designed due date. Your assignment notebook (which include your writeup and codes) should be submitted to Gradescope as a PDF with the answers to each question tagged (a failure to do this will result in deductions).\nA standard rubric is available.\nStudents in 5850 will be asked to complete additional homework problems which go more deeply into the underlying concepts or apply more advanced techniques.\nRegrade requests for specific problems must be made within a week of the grading of that assignment.\n\n\n\nTerm Project\nThroughout the semester, students will apply the concepts and methods from class to a data set of their choosing. If a student does not have a data set in mind, we will find one which aligns with their interests.\nThe term project can be completed individually or in groups of 2. Students will provide updates throughout the semester corresponding to the various tasks discussed in each module and will submit a final report at the end of the semester. The deliverables are:\n\nA proposal describing the research question and hypotheses, the data set, and the numerical or statistical models the student would like to use to test the hypotheses;\nA simulation study applying simulation methods to the models;\nA final presentation and report.",

    "text": "Fitting A Linear Regression Model\nLet’s start with a simple example: fitting a linear regression model to simulated data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Control Tests\n\n\n\nSimulating data with a known data-generating process and then trying to obtain the parameters for that process is an important step in any workflow.\n\n\n\nSimulating Data\nThe data-generating process for this example will be: \\[\n\\begin{gather}\ny = 5 + 2x + \\varepsilon \\\\\n\\varepsilon \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 3),\n\\end{gather}\n\\] where \\(\\varepsilon\\) is so-called “white noise”, which adds stochasticity to the data set. The generated dataset is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot of our generated data.\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Specification\nThe statistical model for a standard linear regression problem is \\[\n\\begin{gather}\ny = a + bx + \\varepsilon \\\\\n\\varepsilon \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma).\n\\end{gather}\n\\]\nRearranging, we can rewrite the likelihood function as: \\[y \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma),\\] where \\(\\mu = a + bx\\). This means that we have three parameters to fit: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nNext, we need to select priors on our parameters. We’ll use relatively generic distributions to avoid using the information we have (since we generated the data ourselves), but in practice, we’d want to use any relevant information that we had from our knowledge of the problem. Let’s use relatively diffuse normal distributions for the trend parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and a half-normal distribution (a normal distribution truncated at 0, to only allow positive values) for the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), as recommended by Gelman (2006).\n\nGelman, A.

We’ll follow the setup in the Turing documentation.\nTo specify distributions on parameters (and the data, which can be thought of as uncertain parameters in Bayesian statistics), use a tilde ~, and use equals = for transformations (which we don’t have in this case).\n\n@model function linear_regression(x, y)\n    # set priors\n1    σ ~ truncated(Normal(0, 25); lower=0)\n2    a ~ Normal(0, 10)\n    b ~ Normal(0, 10)\n\n    # compute the likelihood\n3    for i = 1:length(y)\n        # compute the mean value for the data point\n        μ = a + b * x[i]\n        y[i] ~ Normal(μ, σ)\n    end\nend\n\n\n1\n\nStandard deviations must be positive, so we use a normal distribution truncated at zero.\n\n2\n\nWe’ll keep these both relative uninformative to reflect a more “realistic” modeling scenario.\n\n3\n\nIn this case, we specify the likelihood with a loop. We could also rewrite this as a joint likelihood over all of the data using linear algebra, which might be more efficient for large and/or complex models or datasets, but the loop is more readable in this simple case.\n\n\n\n\nlinear_regression (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\n\n\nFitting The Model\nNow we can call the sampler to draw from the posterior. We’ll use the No-U-Turn sampler (Hoffman & Gelman, 2014), which is a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm (a different category of MCMC sampler than the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm discussed in class). We’ll also use 4 chains so we can test that the chains are well-mixed, and each chain will be run for 5,000 iterations1\n\nHoffman, M. D., & Gelman, A. (2014). The No-U-Turn sampler: Adaptively setting path lengths in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. J. Mach. Learn. Res., 15(47), 1593–1623.\n1 Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers often need to be run for fewer iterations than Metropolis-Hastings samplers, as the exploratory step uses information about the gradient of the statistical model, versus the random walk of Metropolis-Hastings. The disadvantage is that this gradient information must be available, which is not always the case for external simulation models. Simulation models coded in Julia can usually be automatically differentiated by Turing’s tools, however.\n# set up the sampler\n1model = linear_regression(x, y)\n2n_chains = 4\n3n_per_chain = 5000\n4chain = sample(model, NUTS(), MCMCThreads(), n_per_chain, n_chains, drop_warmup=true)\n5@show chain\n\n\n1\n\nInitialize the model with the data.\n\n2\n\nWe use multiple chains to help diagnose convergence.\n\n3\n\nThis sets the number of iterations for each chain.\n\n4\n\nSample from the posterior using NUTS and drop the iterations used to warmup the sampler. The MCMCThreads() call tells the sampler to use available processor threads for the multiple chains, but it will just sample them in serial if only one thread exists.\n\n5\n\nThe @show macro makes the display of the output a bit cleaner.\n\n\n\n\n┌ Warning: Only a single thread available: MCMC chains are not sampled in parallel\n└ @ AbstractMCMC ~/.julia/packages/AbstractMCMC/Es490/src/sample.jl:307\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.003125\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.003125\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.00625\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.000390625\nSampling (1 threads):  50%|██████████████▌              |  ETA: 0:00:00Sampling (1 threads): 100%|█████████████████████████████| Time: 0:00:01\n\n\nchain = MCMC chain (5000×15×4 Array{Float64, 3})\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (5000×15×4 Array{Float64, 3}):\nIterations        = 1001:1:6000\nNumber of chains  = 4\nSamples per chain = 5000\nWall duration     = 8.57 seconds\nCompute duration  = 7.08 seconds\nparameters        = σ, a, b\ninternals         = lp, n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size\nSummary Statistics\n  parameters      mean       std      mcse    ess_bulk    ess_tail      rhat   ⋯\n      Symbol   Float64   Float64   Float64     Float64     Float64   Float64   ⋯\n           σ    5.3995    0.9907    0.0106   8907.8053   8357.6551    1.0008   ⋯\n           a    7.3413    2.1497    0.0228   8980.2158   9558.6500    1.0006   ⋯\n           b    1.7991    0.1916    0.0020   8980.6008   9477.6142    1.0006   ⋯\n                                                                1 column omitted\nQuantiles\n  parameters      2.5%     25.0%     50.0%     75.0%     97.5% \n      Symbol   Float64   Float64   Float64   Float64   Float64 \n           σ    3.8939    4.6953    5.2650    5.9393    7.7752\n           a    2.9639    5.9700    7.3826    8.7456   11.5116\n           b    1.4242    1.6757    1.7948    1.9202    2.1879\n\n\n\n\nHow can we interpret the output? The first parts of the summary statistics are straightforward: we get the mean, standard deviation, and Monte Carlo standard error (mcse) of each parameter. We also get information about the effective sample size (ESS)2 and \\(\\hat{R}\\), which measures the ratio of within-chain variance and across-chain variance as a check for convergence3.\n2 The ESS reflects the efficiency of the sampler: this is an estimate of the equivalent number of independent samples; the more correlated the samples, the lower the ESS.3 The closer \\(\\hat{R}\\) is to 1, the better.In this case, we can see that we were generally able to recover the “true” data-generating values of \\(\\sigma = 4\\) and \\(b = 2\\), but \\(a\\) is slightly off (the mean is 3, rather than the data-generating value of 5). In fact, there is substantial uncertainty about \\(a\\), with a 95% credible interval of \\((3.1, 11.4)\\) (compared to \\((1.4, 2.2)\\) for \\(b\\)). This isn’t surprising: given the variance of the noise \\(\\sigma^2\\), there are many different intercepts which could fit within that spread.\nLet’s now plot the chains for visual inspection.\n\nplot(chain)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Output from the MCMC sampler. Each row corresponds to a different parameter: \\(\\sigma\\), \\(a\\), and \\(b\\). Each chain is shown in a different color. The left column shows the sampler traceplots, and the right column the resulting posterior distributions.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from Figure 2 that our chains mixed well and seem to have converged to similar distributions! The traceplots have a “hairy caterpiller” appearance, suggesting relatively little autocorrelation. We can also see how much more uncertainty there is with the intercept \\(a\\), while the slope \\(b\\) is much more constrained.\nAnother interesting comparison we can make is with the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE), which we can obtain through optimization.\n\nmle_model = linear_regression(x, y)\n1mle = optimize(mle_model, MLE())\ncoef(mle)\n\n\n1\n\nThis is where we use the Optim.jl package in this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n3-element Named Vector{Float64}\nA  │ \n───┼────────\nσ  │ 4.75545\na  │ 7.65636\nb  │ 1.77736\n\nWe could also get the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, which includes the prior density, by replacing MLE() with MAP().\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics and Posterior Predictive Checks\nOne advantage of the Bayesian modeling approach here is that we have access to a generative model, or a model which we can use to generate datasets. This means that we can now use Monte Carlo simulation, sampling from our posteriors, to look at how uncertainty in the parameter estimates propagates through the model. Let’s write a function which gets samples from the MCMC chains and generates datasets.\n\nfunction mc_predict_regression(x, chain)\n    # get the posterior samples\n1    a = Array(group(chain, :a))\n    b = Array(group(chain, :b))\n    σ = Array(group(chain, :σ))\n\n    # loop and generate alternative realizations\n    μ = a' .+ x * b'\n    y = zeros((length(x), length(a)))\n    for i = 1:length(a)\n        y[:, i] = rand.(Normal.(μ[:, i], σ[i]))\n    end\n    return y\nend\n\n\n1\n\nThe Array(group()) syntax is more general than we need, but is useful if we have multiple variables which were sampled as a group, for example multiple regression coefficients. Otherwise, we can just use e.g. Array(chain, :a).\n\n\n\n\nmc_predict_regression (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nNow we can generate a predictive interval and median and compare to the data.\n\nx_pred = 0:20\ny_pred = mc_predict_regression(x_pred, chain)\n\n21×20000 Matrix{Float64}:\n -2.40865    1.9357    10.5589    15.7446   …   6.26661    0.222214  10.1702\n 10.7976    18.8545     0.296641   3.38924     10.5971    10.8189    15.9384\n -0.417529  -0.885769   5.56482    7.39414     -0.981201   7.27796    6.9013\n  4.33488   11.1663     9.51384    9.95352      5.88792   10.313     11.4574\n  5.26926    5.42713   20.2392    13.7574      17.4582    10.5193     8.7948\n 15.825     16.9226    19.3498    28.6916   …  13.6763    15.6275     6.24528\n 16.504     14.0514    13.6398    18.3671      14.349     18.3797    14.9837\n 23.6586    26.4983    29.1236    21.162       20.1668    20.2031    28.3504\n 16.5461    23.2524    20.7667    22.3589      12.5181     9.4516    12.7805\n 32.7533    13.6189    17.0692    26.5378      26.2872    16.5962    26.4759\n 17.9741    32.456     28.7925    25.5402   …  29.5071    30.4289    14.6678\n 27.0943    25.5964    20.0313    27.9132      33.8335    28.1729    26.8888\n 30.6918    18.5685    30.0918    34.6757      23.5247    27.7565    28.9372\n 27.8009    39.4466    34.1512    34.7717      30.2555    36.9157    26.2247\n 26.9089    34.0929    36.0757    39.6863      28.6581    33.8906    35.4109\n 44.642     31.9187    37.0507    25.4562   …  34.3312    27.4952    23.2894\n 47.9252    36.3149    34.642     37.9717      41.1715    34.784     36.6823\n 39.9288    27.0537    33.4583    42.8428      41.3582    32.8539    31.7867\n 44.4605    34.1545    46.2137    35.4133      42.2067    39.4086    36.1819\n 43.712     42.4212    41.7049    50.7652      51.3167    33.0422    49.135\n 45.9144    43.2963    52.2372    50.891    …  39.7291    52.5323    46.89\n\n\nNotice the dimension of y_pred: we have 20,000 columns, because we have 4 chains with 5,000 samples each.

The goal shouldn’t be to hit a specific level of uncertainty, but if there is a sound reason to tighten the priors, we could do so.\nNow let’s look at the residuals from the posterior median and the data. The partial autocorrelations plotted in Figure 4 are not fully convincing, as there are large autocorrelation coefficients with long lags, but the dataset is quite small, so it’s hard to draw strong conclusions.

    "text": "Fitting Extreme Value Models to Tide Gauge Data\nLet’s now look at an example of fitting an extreme value distribution (namely, a generalized extreme value distribution, or GEV) to tide gauge data. GEV distributions have three parameters:\n\n\\(\\mu\\), the location parameter, which reflects the positioning of the bulk of the GEV distribution;\n\\(\\sigma\\), the scale parameter, which reflects the width of the bulk;\n\\(\\xi\\), the shape parameter, which reflects the thickness and boundedness of the tail.\n\nThe shape parameter \\(\\xi\\) is often of interest, as there are three classes of GEV distributions corresponding to different signs:\n\n\\(\\xi &lt; 0\\) means that the distribution is bounded;\n\\(\\xi = 0\\) means that the distribution has a thinner tail, so the “extreme extremes” are less likely;\n\\(\\xi &gt; 0\\) means that the distribution has a thicker tail.\n\n\nLoad Data\nFirst, let’s load the data. We’ll use data from the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (Caldwell et al., 2015) for San Francisco, from 1897-2013.

However, if these parameters are increased, the shape parameter \\(\\xi\\) decreases, as the tail of the GEV does not need to be as thick due to the increased proximity of outliers to the bulk.",

    "text": "Meta-Rubric\n\nIndividual problems may vary from these standard rubrics based on the assessed learning outcomes for the problem, but they should provide an overview of what features students ought to be included in a given solution.\nEach bullet point should appear as a separate rubric item in Gradescope. We will use positive grading (points awarded for each component).\nEach standard rubric describes partial credit for a problem with 10 points. Partial credit for (sub)problems worth less than 10 points should be scaled appropriately. Full problems usually combine one of the modeling methods with some interpretation questions, so the rubric will be a combination of the individual components.\nGenerally, rubrics for 10 point “entire problems” can be summarized with the following:\n\n+4 points for an answer with a correct implementation (including model setup).\n+2 points for the correct solution (including details such as labels, units, etc.).\n+4 points for the interpretation. These points may be broken up across subproblems, but the general assignment of points should follow this summary.\n\nNote that the points may not scale with the distribution of work for a given problem. That’s life! It may take more work to derive and implement your model than it does to intrepret your results, but in this class we care a lot about your ability to critically evaluate and interpret modeling results.\nSometimes problems will be broken up into\nThe graders cannot read your mind and will not try to. Submissions that are unclear for any reason, including but not limited to unclear syntax (English or code), uncommented code, lack of reasoning or derivation, too much detail or writing, will not be given credit. The grader has complete discretion here. If something in your solution is ambiguous, the grader has been instructed to interpret it the “wrong” way. Clear responses are a sign of understanding, which is part of what we’re assessing.\nYou will not be doubly penalized for getting the “right” solution to the “wrong” setup (you would have been penalized above), but this requires the grader to be able to easily identify that your implementation is correct given the wrong model. If your implementation is unclear, you are likely to lose points here because we have no way of knowing that your answer is “right” without re-coding your problem.\nYou will not be given credit for your code (this isn’t a programming class); the code is a means to solving the problem, and we’re more interested in how you set up the problem and interpret the solution. This does mean that code that is sloppy but works is perfectly acceptable. However, your code may get you partial credit if the TA can easily find where you made a mistake, so make sure your submitted code is well commented. It’s important to write down the mathematics of what your code is trying to implement, because the TA will only take a cursory look at your code.\nSome rubrics include “deadly sins” which will cause an immediate zero to be given for the problem. Do not do these!\nRegardless of the problem type, the following penalties will be applied per incident:\n\n-1 for missing units.",

    "section": "How To Write Assignments",
    "text": "How To Write Assignments\nHere are some tips for how to make the grader (the TA or Prof. Srikrishnan) understand what you mean in the time they’re looking at your problem: as noted in the rubrics, if your solution isn’t clear enough for us to follow, you will not receive the points even if your answer is technically correct, because part of demonstrating understanding is the ability to organize and communicate.\n\nBe Honest\n\nWrite everything in your own words. It’s perfectly ok to work with others; in fact, we encourage it! But you should write up and implement everything yourself; it’s very easy to convince yourself that you understand something when you’re mimicking someone else’s solution, and often we realize we don’t actually understand something when we try to write it ourselves.\nCite every outside source you use. You are allowed, in fact encouraged, to use any outside source1 Getting an idea from an outside source is not a problem, and will not lower your grade; if you’re critically evaluating the idea and implementing and writing your solution yourself (see above), then you’re demonstrating understanding even if the idea originated with someone else. But you must give appropriate credit to that source. Taking credit for someone else’s ideas and failing to properly cite an outside source, including your classmates, is plagiarism, and will be treated accordingly.\nThe only sources you do not have to cite are official class materials. If you use the lectures, lecture notes, website materials, homework solutions, etc, you do not have to cite these.\nList everyone that you worked with. Give your classmates proper credit for their assistance. If you get an idea from Ed Discussion, credit the poster. If you’re not sure if you should list someone as a collaborator, err on the side of including them. For discussions in class or in office hours, you don’t have to list everyone who participated in the discussion (though you should if you worked one on one with them), but mention that the class discussion or the office hour was useful.\n\n1 Yes, including ChatGPT, though you should ask and describe how you used it.\n\nBe Clear\n\nWrite legibly. This doesn’t refer to handwriting (since you’ll be submitting PDFs of Jupyter notebooks), but the text itself should be clearly written and well organized, so that it’s easy for the grader to follow your reasoning or explanation. Structuring your solution, and not writing in a stream of consciousness, helps you think more clearly. To reiterate: You will be given no points if the grader cannot easily follow your answer, and the graders have complete discretion to determine this.\nWrite clearly. Use proper spelling, grammar, logic, etc. We will try not to penalize people for not having complete mastery of English, but again, we need to be able to follow your reasoning.\nWrite carefully and completely. We can only grade what you write; nobody can read your mind, and we will not try. The solution that you submit must stand on its own. If your answer is ambiguous, the TA has been instructed to interpret it the wrong way. Regrade requests also cannot be used to add more information to a solution.\nDon’t submit your first draft. For most people, first drafts are terrible. They are often poorly organized, unclear, and contain gaps or jumps in reasoning. You will likely need to revise, possibly several times, for your answer to be clear, careful, and complete. This is another reason to start the assignment early — if you start late, you may be stuck with your first draft, and your grade is likely to suffer for it.\nState your assumptions. If you think a problem statement is ambiguous and your solution depends on a particular interpretation, or you need to make some assumptions to solve the problem, make it explicit (though do also ask for clarification in class or on Ed Discussion).\nDon’t rely on your code. The TA will not try to scrutinize your code, which is a waste of time (again, the code is a means to an end — it works or it doesn’t). If you make it clear what your code is supposed to do, then the TA can tell if this logic is correct and any mistake must be something minor in the code. If you just provide code (even if commented), the TA can’t do this without running your code and debugging, which is not a valuable use of time. We want to focus on your ideas.\n\n\n\nBe Concise\n\nKeep solutions short. Organized answers should not be long. There’s a fine balance between conciseness and completeness: find it!\nDon’t regurgitate. You can reference concepts, models, etc from class without repeating them. Just make it clear what you’re modifying and how you’re using those concepts for that particular problem.\nDon’t bullshit. You will get no points for word salad, even if you accidentally hit on the right answer.",

This problem was adapted from Bayesian Methods for Hackers.\nProblem 3 asks you to assess the quality of fit of a normal distribution to realizations from a Galton Board simulation.\nProblem 4 (graded only for graduate students) asks you to simulate outcomes from the Price Is Right Showcase game to identify a bidding strategy.\n\n\n\nLoad Environment\nThe following code loads the environment and makes sure all needed packages are installed.

    "section": "Problems",
    "text": "Problems\nEach problem in this assignment is worth 10 points.\n\nProblem 1\nThe underlying question we would like to address is: what is the influence of drinking beer on the likelihood of being bitten by mosquitoes? There is a mechanistic reason why this might occur: mosquitoes are attracted by changes in body temperature and released CO2, and it might be that drinking beer induces these changes. We’ll analyze this question using (synthetic) data which separates an experimental population into two groups, one which drank beer and the other which drank only water.\nFirst, we’ll load data for the number of bites reported by the participants who drank beer. This is in a comma-delimited file, data/bites.csv (which is grossly overkill for this assignment). Each row contains two columns: the group (beer and water) the person belonged to and the number of times that person was bitten.\nIn Julia, we can do this using CSVFiles.jl, which will read in the .csv file into a DataFrame, which is a typical data structure for tabular data (and equivalent to a Pandas DataFrame in Python or a dataframe in R).\n\n\ndata = DataFrame(load(\"data/bites.csv\")) # load data into DataFrame\n\n# print data variable (semi-colon suppresses echoed output in Julia, which in this case would duplicate the output)\n@show data; \n\n\nHow can we tell if there’s a meaningful difference between the two groups? Naively, we might just look at the differences in group means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadcasting\n\n\n\nThe subsetting operations in the below code use .==, which “broadcasts” the element-wise comparison operator == across every element. The decimal in front of == indicates that this should be used element-wise (every pair of elements compared for equality, returning a vector of true or false values); otherwise Julia would try to just check for vector equality (returning a single true or false value).\nBroadcasting is a very specific feature of Julia, so this syntax would look different in a different programming language.\n\n\n\n# split data into vectors of bites for each group\nbeer = data[data.group .== \"beer\", :bites]\nwater = data[data.group .== \"water\", :bites]\n\nobserved_difference = mean(beer) - mean(water)\n@show observed_difference;\n\nobserved_difference = 4.37777777777778\n\n\n\nThis tells us that, on average, the participants in the experiment who drank beer were bitten approximately 4.4 more times than the participants who drank water! Does that seem like a meaningful difference, or could it be the result of random chance?\nWe will use a simulation approach to address this question, as follows.\n\nSuppose someone is skeptical of the idea that drinking beer could result in a higher attraction to mosquitoes, and therefore more bites. To this skeptic, the two datasets are really just different samples from the same underlying population of people getting bitten by mosquitoes, rather than two different populations with different propensities for being bitten. This is the skeptic’s hypothesis, versus our hypothesis that drinking beer changes body temperature and CO2 release sufficiently to attract mosquitoes.\nIf the skeptic’s hypothesis is true, then we can “shuffle” all of the measurements between the two datasets and re-compute the differences in the means. After repeating this procedure a large number of times, we would obtain a distribution of the differences in means under the assumption that the skeptic’s hypothesis is true.\nComparing our experimentally-observed difference to this distribution, we can then evaluate the consistency of the skeptic’s hypothesis with the experimental results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do We Call This A Simulation-Based Approach?\n\n\n\nThis is a simulation-based approach because the “shuffling” is a non-parametric way of generating new samples from the underlying distribution (more on this later in the semester).\nThe alternative to this approach is to use a statistical test, such as a t-test, which may have other assumptions which may not be appropriate for this setting, particularly given the seemingly small sample sizes.\n\n\n\nIn this problem:\n\nConduct the above procedure to generate 50,000 simulated datasets under the skeptic’s hypothesis.\nPlot a histogram of the results and add a dashed vertical line to show the experimental difference (if you are using Julia, feel free to look at the Making Plots with Julia tutorial on the class website).\nDraw conclusions about the plausibility of the skeptic’s hypothesis that there is no difference between groups. Feel free to use any quantitative or qualitative assessments of your simulations and the observed difference.\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nYou are trying to detect if how prevalent cheating was on an exam. You are skeptical of the efficacy of just asking the students if they cheated. You are also concerned about privacy — your goal is not to punish individual students, but to see if there are systemic problems that need to be addressed. Someone proposes the following interview procedure, which the class agrees to participate in:\n\nEach student flips a fair coin, with the results hidden from the interviewer. The student answers honestly if the coin comes up heads. Otherwise, if the coin comes up tails, the student flips the coin again, and answers “I did cheat” if heads, and “I did not cheat”, if tails.\n\nWe have a hypothesis that cheating was not prevalent, and the proportion of cheaters was no more than 5% of the class; in other words, we expect 5 “true” cheaters out of a class of 100 students. Our TA is more jaded and thinks that cheating was more rampant, and that 30% of the class cheated. The proposed interview procedure is noisy: the interviewer does not know if an admission means that the student cheated, or the result of a heads. However, it gives us a data-generating process that we can model and analyze for consistency with our hypothesis and that of the TA.\nIn this problem:\n\nDerive and code a simulation model for the above interview procedure given the “true” probability of cheating \\(p\\).\nSimulate your model (for a class of 100 students) 50,000 times under the your hypothesis and the TA’s hypothesis, and plot the two resulting datasets.\nIf you received 31 “Yes, I cheated” responses while interviewing your class, what could you conclude? Feel free to use any qualitative or quantiative assessments to justify your conclusions.\nHow useful do you think the interview procedure is to identify systemic teaching? What changes to the design might you make?\n\n\n\nProblem 3 (10 points)\nSuppose that we ask a class of students to walk individually from one end of a field to the other and count the number of steps that they take in order to cover the distance. More than likely, each student will get a somewhat different answer. After each student has paced off the field, we then make a histogram of the number of steps taken by the individual students. For a sufficiently large number of students, this histogram would resemble a normal distribution, due to the Central Limit Theorem.\nA Galton board (named after Sir Francis Galton, a pioneering statistician1, shown below, is a physical device that demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem. A Galton board has rows of pins arranged in a triangular shape, with each row of pins offset horizontally relative to the rows above and below it. As illustrated in Figure 1, the top row has one pin, the second row has two pins, and so forth. If you’ve watched The Price is Right, you’ve seen this as “Plinko”.\n1 And, notably, a leading eugenicist, which is unfortunately a recurring theme with leading early statisticians…)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Galton Board simulation. The top shows a schematic of how the Galton board works and the bottom shows a histogram of the landing positions after 200 simulations.\n\n\n\n\nIf a ball is dropped into the Galton board, it falls either to the right or the left when it bounces off the top pin. The ball then falls all the way to the bottom of the board, moving slightly to the right or left as it passes through each row of pins. Bins at the bottom of the board capture the ball and record its final position. If this experiment is repeated with many balls, the number of balls in each bin resembles a normal distribution, which is expected due to the Central Limit Theorem.\nYour goal in this exercise is to explore how well a normal distribution fits the outcomes of repeated Galton Board trials as the number increases using quantile-quantile plots. Assessing the appropriateness of a probability model for a data set is a key part of exploratory analysis; we will return to this theme repeatedly. Or, to put it another way, it’s time for you to play Plinko!\nIn this problem:\n\nWrite a function galton_sim which simulates n Galton board trials (assume the board has 8 board rows, as in the image above) and returns a vector with the number of balls which fall into each bin. You can assume (for now) that the board is fair, e.g. that the probability of a left or right bounce is 0.5; you may want to make this probability a function parameter so you can change it later.\nRun your simulation for a sample of 50 balls. Create a histogram of the results, with each bar corresponding to one bin. Make sure you use a random seed for reproducibility, and label your axes!\nEach Galton board trial can be represented as a realization from a binomial distribution. But as we noted above, by the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of a large enough number of trials should be approximately normal. Use a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot to compare a fitted normal distribution with your simulation results. How well does a normal distribution fit the data?\nRepeat your simulation experiment with 250 trials and compare to a normal distribution. Does it describe the empirical distribution better?\nIf the probability of a left bounce is 70%, what does this do to the fit of a normal distribution? What other distribution might you use if not a normal and why?\n\n\n\nProblem 4\nGRADED FOR 5850 STUDENTS ONLY\nYour mastery of the Central Limit Theorem has led you to win your game of Plinko, and it’s time for the Showcases. This is the final round of an episode of The Price is Right, matching the two big winners from the episode. Each contestant is shown a “showcase” of prizes, which are usually some combination of a trip, a motor vehicle, some furniture, and maybe some other stuff. They then each have to make a bid on the retail price of the showcase. The rules are:\n\nan overbid is an automatic loss;\nthe contest who gets closest to the retail price wins their showcase;\nif a contestant gets within \\(\\$250\\) of the retail price and is closer than their opponent, they win both showcases.\n\nThanks to exhaustive statistics kept by game show fans, in Season 51 of The Price is Right showcase values had the following properties:\n\nmedian: $33,0481;\nlowest-value: $20,432\nhighest-value: $72,409\n\nIn this problem:\n\nWrite down a model which encodes the Showcase rules as a function of the showcase value and your bid. You can assume that your wagering is independent of your opponent.\nSelect and fit a distribution to the above statistics (you have some freedom to pick a distribution, but make sure you justify it).\nUsing 1,000 samples from your price distribution in your model, plot the expected winnings for bids from $20,000 through $72,000.\nFind the bid which maximizes your expected winnings. If you were playing The Price Is Right, is this the strategy you would adopt, or are there other considerations you would take into account which were not included in this model?",

Effectively, TAB after you finish typing the name of each \\character.\n\nβ₁ = 10 # The name of this variable was entered with \\beta + TAB + \\_1 + TAB\n\n10\n\n\nHowever, try not to overwrite predefined names! For example, you might not want to use π as a variable name…\n\nπ\n\nπ = 3.1415926535897...\n\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, overwriting π is not a huge deal unless you want to do some trigonometry. However, there are more important predefined functions and variables that you may want to be aware of. Always check that a variable or function name is not predefined!",

    "text": "Data Types\nEach datum (importantly, not the variable which is bound to it) has a data type. Julia types are similar to C types, in that they require not only the type of data (Int, Float, String, etc), but also the precision (which is related to the amount of memory allocated to the variable). Issues with precision won’t be a big deal in this class, though they matter when you’re concerned about performance vs. decimal accuracy of code.\nYou can identify the type of a variable or expression with the typeof() function.\n\ntypeof(\"This is a string.\")\n\nString\n\n\n\ntypeof(x)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\nNumeric types\nA key distinction is between an integer type (or Int) and a floating-point number type (or float). Integers only hold whole numbers, while floating-point numbers correspond to numbers with fractional (or decimal) parts. For example, 9 is an integer, while 9.25 is a floating point number. The difference between the two has to do with the way the number is stored in memory. 9, an integer, is handled differently in memory than 9.0, which is a floating-point number, even though they’re mathematically the same value.\n\ntypeof(9)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\ntypeof(9.25)\n\nFloat64\n\n\nSometimes certain function specifications will require you to use a Float variable instead of an Int. One way to force an Int variable to be a Float is to add a decimal point at the end of the integer.\n\ntypeof(9.)\n\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\nStrings\nStrings hold characters, rather than numeric values. Even if a string contains what seems like a number, it is actually stored as the character representation of the digits.

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nA function is an object which accepts a tuple of arguments and maps them to a return value. In Julia, functions are defined using the following syntax.\n\nfunction my_actual_function(x, y)\n    return x + y\nend\nmy_actual_function(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\nFunctions in Julia do not require explicit use of a return statement. They will return the last expression evaluated in their definition. However, it’s good style to explicitly return function outputs. This improves readability and debugging, especially when functions can return multiple expressions based on logical control flows (if-then-else blocks).\nFunctions in Julia are objects, and can be treated like other objects. They can be assigned to new variables or passed as arguments to other functions.\n\ng = my_actual_function\ng(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nfunction function_of_functions(f, x, y)\n    return f(x, y)\nend\nfunction_of_functions(g, 3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nShort and Anonymous Functions\nIn addition to the long form of the function definition shown above, simple functions can be specified in more compact forms when helpful.\nThis is the short form:\n\nh₁(x) = x^2 # make the subscript using \\_1 + &lt;TAB&gt;\nh₁(4)\n\n16\n\n\nThis is the anonymous form:\n\nx-&gt;sin(x)\n(x-&gt;sin(x))(π/4)\n\n0.7071067811865475\n\n\n\n\nMutating Functions\nThe convention in Julia is that functions should not modify (or mutate) their input data. The reason for this is to ensure that the data is preserved. Mutating functions are mainly appropriate for applications where performance needs to be optimized, and making a copy of the input data would be too memory-intensive.\nIf you do write a mutating function in Julia, the convention is to add a ! to its name, like my_mutating_function!(x).\n\n\nOptional arguments\nThere are two extremes with regard to function parameters which do not always need to be changed. The first is to hard-code them into the function body, which has a clear downside: when you do want to change them, the function needs to be edited directly. The other extreme is to treat them as regular arguments, passing them every time the function is called. This has the downside of potentially creating bloated function calls, particularly when there is a standard default value that makes sense for most function evaluations.\nMost modern languages, including Julia, allow an alternate solution, which is to make these arguments optional. This involves setting a default value, which is used unless the argument is explicitly defined in a function call.\n\nfunction setting_optional_arguments(x, y, c=0.5)\n    return c * (x + y)\nend\n\nsetting_optional_arguments (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nIf we want to stick with the fixed value \\(c=0.5\\), all we have to do is call setting_optional_arguments with the x and y arguments.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5)\n\n4.0\n\n\nOtherwise, we can pass a new value for c.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5, 2)\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nPassing data structures as arguments\nInstead of passing variables individually, it may make sense to pass a data structure, such as an array or a tuple, and then unpacking within the function definition. This is straightforward in long form: access the appropriate elements using their index.\nIn short or anonymous form, there is a trick which allows the use of readable variables within the function definition.\n\nh₂((x,y)) = x*y # enclose the input arguments in parentheses to tell Julia to expect and unpack a tuple\n\nh₂ (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nh₂((2, 3)) # this works perfectly, as we passed in a tuple\n\n6\n\n\n\nh₂(2, 3) # this gives an error, as h₂ expects a single tuple, not two different numeric values\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching h₂(::Int64, ::Int64)\n\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  h₂(::Any)\n\u001b[0m\u001b[90m   @\u001b[39m \u001b[32mMain\u001b[39m \u001b[90m\u001b[4mIn[50]:1\u001b[24m\u001b[39m\n\n\n\nh₂([3, 10]) # this also works with arrays instead of tuples\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nVectorized operations\nJulia uses dot syntax to vectorize an operation and apply it element-wise across an array.\nFor example, to calculate the square root of 3:\n\nsqrt(3)\n\n1.7320508075688772\n\n\nTo calculate the square roots of every integer between 1 and 5:\n\nsqrt.([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 1.4142135623730951\n 1.7320508075688772\n 2.0\n 2.23606797749979\n\n\nThe same dot syntax is used for arithmetic operations over arrays, since these operations are really functions.\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4] .* 2\n\n4-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n\n\nVectorization can be faster and is more concise to write and read than applying the same function to multiple variables or objects explicitly, so take advantage!\n\n\nReturning multiple values\nYou can return multiple values by separating them with a comma. This implicitly causes the function to return a tuple of values.\n\nfunction return_multiple_values(x, y)\n    return x + y, x * y\nend\nreturn_multiple_values(3, 5)\n\n(8, 15)\n\n\nThese values can be unpacked into multiple variables.\n\nn, ν = return_multiple_values(3, 5)\nn\n\n8\n\n\n\nν\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nReturning nothing\nSometimes you don’t want a function to return any values at all. For example, you might want a function that only prints a string to the console.\n\nfunction print_some_string(x)\n    println(\"x: $x\")\n    return nothing\nend\nprint_some_string(42)\n\nx: 42",

For example, if we wanted to compute the absolute value of a number, rather than using abs():\n\nfunction our_abs(x)\n    if x &gt;= 0\n        return x\n    else\n        return -x\n    end\nend\n\nour_abs (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nour_abs(4)\n\n4\n\n\n\nour_abs(-4)\n\n4\n\n\nTo nest conditional statements, use elseif.\n\nfunction test_sign(x)\n    if x &gt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is positive.\")\n    elseif x &lt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is negative.\")\n    else\n        return Text(\"x is zero.\")\n    end\nend\n\ntest_sign (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\ntest_sign(-5)\n\nx is negative.\n\n\n\ntest_sign(0)\n\nx is zero.\n\n\n\n\nLoops\nLoops allow expressions to be evaluated repeatedly until they are terminated. The two main types of loops are while loops and for loops.\n\nWhile loops\nwhile loops continue to evaluate an expression so long as a specified boolean condition is true. This is useful when you don’t know how many iterations it will take for the desired goal to be reached.\n\nfunction compute_factorial(x)\n    factorial = 1\n    while (x &gt; 1)\n        factorial *= x\n        x -= 1\n    end\n    return factorial\nend\ncompute_factorial(5)\n\n120\n\n\n\nWhile loops can easily turn into infinite loops if the condition is never meaningfully updated. Be careful, and look there if your programs are getting stuck. Also, If the expression in a while loop is false when the loop is reached, the loop will never be evaluated.\n\n\n\nFor loops\nfor loops run for a finite number of iterations, based on some defined index variable.\n\nfunction add_some_numbers(x)\n    total_sum = 0 # initialize at zero since we're adding\n    for i=1:x # the counter i is updated every iteration\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_some_numbers(4)\n\n10\n\n\nfor loops can also iterate over explicitly passed containers, rather than iterating over an incrementally-updated index sequence. Use the in keyword when defining the loop.\n\nfunction add_passed_numbers(set)\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in set # this is the syntax we use when we want i to correspond to different container values\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_passed_numbers([1, 3, 5])\n\n9",
