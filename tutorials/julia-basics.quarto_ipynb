Effectively, TAB after you finish typing the name of each `\\character`.\n",

        "## Data Types\n",
        "\n",
        "Each datum (importantly, *not* the variable which is bound to it) has a [data type](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/). Julia types are similar to C types, in that they require not only the *type* of data (Int, Float, String, etc), but also the precision (which is related to the amount of memory allocated to the variable). Issues with precision won't be a big deal in this class, though they matter when you're concerned about performance vs. decimal accuracy of code.\n",

        "### Numeric types\n",
        "A key distinction is between an integer type (or *Int*) and a floating-point number type (or *float*). Integers only hold whole numbers, while floating-point numbers correspond to numbers with fractional (or decimal) parts. For example, `9` is an integer, while `9.25` is a floating point number. The difference between the two has to do with the way the number is stored in memory. `9`, an integer, is handled differently in memory than `9.0`, which is a floating-point number, even though they're mathematically the same value.\n",

        "\n",
        "Sometimes certain function specifications will require you to use a Float variable instead of an Int. One way to force an Int variable to be a Float is to add a decimal point at the end of the integer.\n",

        "### Strings\n",
        "Strings hold characters, rather than numeric values. Even if a string contains what seems like a number, it is actually stored as the character representation of the digits. As a result, you cannot use arithmetic operators (for example) on this datum.\n",

        "## Mathematical operations\n",
        "\n",
        "Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division work as you would expect. Just pay attention to types! The type of the output is influenced by the type of the inputs: adding or multiplying an Int by a Float will always result in a Float, even if the Float is mathematically an integer. Division is a little special: dividing an Int by another Int will still return a float, because Julia doesn't know ahead of time if the denominator is a factor of the numerator.\n",

        "## Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "A function is an object which accepts a tuple of arguments and maps them to a return value. In Julia, functions are defined using the following syntax.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions in Julia do not require explicit use of a `return` statement. They will return the last expression evaluated in their definition. However, it's good style to explicitly `return` function outputs. This improves readability and debugging, especially when functions can return multiple expressions based on logical control flows (if-then-else blocks).\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions in Julia are objects, and can be treated like other objects. They can be assigned to new variables or passed as arguments to other functions.\n",

        "### Short and Anonymous Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the long form of the function definition shown above, simple functions can be specified in more compact forms when helpful.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Mutating Functions\n",
        "The convention in Julia is that functions should not modify (or *mutate*) their input data. The reason for this is to ensure that the data is preserved. Mutating functions are mainly appropriate for applications where performance needs to be optimized, and making a copy of the input data would be too memory-intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you do write a mutating function in Julia, the convention is to add a `!` to its name, like `my_mutating_function!(x)`.\n",

        "### Optional arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two extremes with regard to function parameters which do not always need to be changed. The first is to hard-code them into the function body, which has a clear downside: when you do want to change them, the function needs to be edited directly. The other extreme is to treat them as regular arguments, passing them every time the function is called. This has the downside of potentially creating bloated function calls, particularly when there is a standard default value that makes sense for most function evaluations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most modern languages, including Julia, allow an alternate solution, which is to make these arguments *optional*. This involves setting a default value, which is used unless the argument is explicitly defined in a function call.\n",

        "### Passing data structures as arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of passing variables individually, it may make sense to pass a data structure, such as an array or a tuple, and then unpacking within the function definition. This is straightforward in long form: access the appropriate elements using their index.\n",
        "\n",
